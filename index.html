        I am currently a freshman studying electrical engineering at Stanford. I am also interested in math and physics. Recently I have been working 
        on a 
        <a class="highlight" href="https://www.sportsstatisticsindex.com" target="_blank">project</a> 
        to predict the outcome of sporting events using statistical methods.

                    <i>Shackleton’s Incredible Voyage</i> tells a tale so fascinating that it is hard to believe it actually happened. Shackleton and his men were supposed to cross the Antarctic continent in 1914 before their ship got stuck in the ice and was crushed by the resulting pressure. The already extraordinary story is enhanced with suspense and character development that makes the reader root for some (but maybe not all) of the crew.

                    My favorite part of the book is the description of the journey Shackleton and a few of his men took to the nearest whaling station in order to rescue the rest of the crew. The journey was filled with treacherous conditions on both sea and land. The excitement that builds in these chapters is engaging even if the reader knows how the tale ends. It is truly remarkable to think that Shackleton navigated the <a href="https://youtu.be/FPmtQAIfLBQ?t=57" target="_blank"> Drake Passage</a> in a tiny sailboat without enough food and water and after traveling for months in the Antarctic. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The journey that Shackleton planned was not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Trans-Antarctic_Expedition" target="_blank"> completed</a>  for another four decades. The party that ended up carrying it out successfully used tractors and other modern technology that Shackleton did not have access to. The second successful expedition of its kind was not carried out until 1981. This shows how massively ambitious the trip was to begin with and how harsh Antarctic conditions really are. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, Shackleton’s Incredible Voyage reminded me of how human beings are naturally inclined to explore and discover new environments. It was inspiring to read about how a group of people volunteered to partake in such a journey not for fame and fortune, but simply for the adventure. Reading about the journey made me think about how I can apply such lessons to my own life, and possibly become just a little bit better at exploring the world around me. I would highly recommend Shackleton’s Incredible Voyage to anyone interested in Antarctica or looking for an interesting expedition story.

            <p> 
                <i>A Burning</i> is a compelling book for a few reasons. It fuses political themes with an engaging story and idiosyncratic characters. I appreciated the focus on the unintended consequences of a powerful platform like Facebook and how it can create an explosive type of mob rule that is not possible without social media. Putting a personal story to such a new problem is powerful in making the issue stick in the reader’s mind. The thread in the story that I thought was most well portrayed was the need of the people to have an explanation for the attack, even if it was wrong. The people had an extreme discomfort with the idea of the attack being unexplained. Therefore, they grasped at any ounce of evidence that would implicate Jivan. The exploration of this dynamic shows the power of such a demand for justice and how laws and customs can be bent in such situations. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A Burning also stressed the issue of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronakdesai/2020/03/03/india-failing-to-make-progress-in-its-campaign-against-corruption/?sh=342ce1dee127" target="_blank">political corruption in India</a>  to me. PT Sir’s journey shows that even those with good intentions can get sucked in by the allure of power and influence. His path showed how one looking to get ahead in a corrupt system has to erode their morals slowly. This results in cumulative changes that are only apparent after a long time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                While the conclusion of the novel was unsatisfying and sad, I think it was the only fitting way to end the story. A surprise triumph or victory would lessen the emphasis on the issues discussed in the book and leave the reader less worried. Majumdar leaves the reader with a bad feeling, and this makes the story all the more impactful. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall I would recommend <i>A Burning</i> to anyone looking to understand the psychology of social media better and how this has implications for things like law and politics. In many ways it highlighted things I already knew, but also shed light on how topics such as trans issues and the film industry or political corruption and education can intersect.
