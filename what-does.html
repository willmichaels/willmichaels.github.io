            Being a mathematician is a foreign experience to most since those doing math research seem to work alone on complex topics with little grounding in everyday life. <i>Birth of a Theorem</i> shows the reader that math research is a field intrinsically tied to the human experience. Those looking to expand our knowledge of math have to grapple with many of the same obstacles most people do in their working lives.

            <i>Birth of a Theorem</i> follows the author through the journey involving his most impactful work that eventually won him the Fields Medal. Obviously much of his time was spent thinking about math, but the author also had to contend with more practical issues such as communicating with collaborators, traveling, and his family. Seeing the work of a mathematician from this perspective makes the field seem more approachable and less intimidating. The author shows that even the best mathematicians get stuck in their work and reach dead ends. It is rare for a mathematician to follow a straight path from an idea to its execution.

            Another interesting idea explored in <i>Birth of a Theorem</i> is the fame and prestige attached to an award such as the Fields Medal. Despite what many wish for the field, research mathematics is still plagued by greed for things such as status and notoriety. The author explains such issues from an insider perspective and shows that being a mathematician is often about much more than one's ability to do math. One must consider how, when, and with whom they share their ideas.

            <i>Birth of a Theorem</i> is a well written book from a perspective that is not often heard from. It is rare to find a mathematician who is so prolific and can share his experience so clearly. Cédric Villani is able to tell a compelling story without sacrificing accuracy or detail. I would recommend it to anyone interested in math or the experience of mathematicians.
